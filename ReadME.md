#Clean-code-design-patterns.

This project contains an implementation of 
the various design patterns described in the book Design patterns: Elements Of resuable Object-oriented Software.

The book was written in C++. So I'm Implementing these patterns in java. Also 
this is a sandbox for me to try the spock framework, mockito, and junit5.
